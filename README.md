This repository contains
1. data folder -  CVS with the main data used through out this thesis and Results from running the Python file.
2. Eigen_GARCH.py - Contains the Eigen_GARCH function used to generate the results for the Dynamic Eigen GARCH model.
3. Descriptive_Analysis.R - R script used to generate for the Descriptive analysis.
4. Eigen_garch_GMVP.ipynb - Notebook used to generate the results for the λ-MGARCH in the Empirical analysis.
5. MGARCH_MVP.R - R script used to generate the results for the GO-GARCH and the DCC-GARCH in the Empirical analysis.
6. Replication_Hetland_et_al.ipynb - Notebook used to generate results based from Table 1 in Hetland et al. (2022)

## The Dynamic Conditional Eigenvalue MGARCH model: An Empirical and Economic Evaluation

Our project is titled **An evaluation of the economic performance of the multivariate Dynamic Conditional Eigenvalue GARCH model compared with existing GARCH models**. Results for out Master thesis in economics from the university of Copenhagen. This repository contains the algorithm for the Dynamic Conditional Eigenvalue GARCH model (λ-MGARCH) introduced in Hetland et al. (2022 JoE).

This GitHub is constructed to provide the reader of our thesis, with full access to all of our code. Nonetheless, if one is interested in running all the results manually, the files should be run in the following order: Descriptive_Analysis.R, Python file, R file. 
**Estimated run time:** 10 hours. 

**OBS.** To run the files, you would need to change the the working directory, and make other minor changes in the files.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 and R installation, the project requires multiple other installations, these can be found at the top of every script.
