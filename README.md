# An evaluation of the economic performance of the multivariate Dynamic Conditional Eigenvalue GARCH model compared with existing GARCH models

Our project is titled **An evaluation of the economic performance of the multivariate Dynamic Conditional Eigenvalue GARCH model compared with existing GARCH models**. Results for out Master thesis in economics from the university of Copenhagen. This repository contains the algorithm for the Dynamic Conditional Eigenvalue GARCH model (Î»-MGARCH) introduced in Hetland et al. (2022 JoE).

The **results** (tables, figures) of the project can be seen from running [Results.ipynb](Results.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install chaospy``
``pip install pathlib``
